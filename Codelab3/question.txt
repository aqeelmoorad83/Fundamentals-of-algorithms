Part 1: Creating a program to generate the below series

For an input n, where n > 0, generate the following series,

If n =1, return 1
If n = 2, return 11
If n = 3, return 21
If n = 4, return 1211
If n = 5, return 111221 
If n = 6, return 312211
If n = 7, return 13112221
If n = 8, return 1113213211

The pattern followed by this series should be pretty intuitive. As you can see, when n = 1, the return value is 1. Then you can read out the number loud i.e. 1 can be read as “one one” because there is only one 1. So the return value should be 11 for n = 2. Similarly, for n = 3, the program should return 21 because there are two ones in 11.   
After that, see the above example to understand what you have to return for any given n. 

You may notice that this will be a very costly program timewise because for any n > 1, you first have to start with n = 1 and n = 2 and so on (remember factorial and palindrome problems where you had to do something similar ?).
